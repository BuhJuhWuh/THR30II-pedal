The Yamaha THRII-series is a guitar practice amplifier.

There is a smartphone app and a PC and Mac applicationt to control all the sound parameters.
There even is a bluetooth connection for using foot switches with this amp. But you always need the smartphone app running to use a bluetooth foot switch.
Furthermore you can only switch some dedicated parameters with a bluetooth footswitch.

My project's goal is to avoid the sometimes not very stable bluetooth connection and connect directly to the amp via USB-cable.
It is possible to send whole "patch" settings including a complete set of parameters by pressing a button on the board with your foot.
